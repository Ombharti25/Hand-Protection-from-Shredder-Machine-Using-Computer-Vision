# Hand Protection from Shredder Machine using Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using computer vision to protect hands from shredder machine injuries. The system detects hand movements in real-time and instantly stops the machine to prevent accidents.

## Key Features
- Real-time hand movement detection.
- Immediate shredder stop to prevent injuries.
- Adapts to different lighting and hand positions.
- Seamless integration with existing safety protocols.

## Objectives
1. Enhance worker safety.
2. Detect threats in real-time.
3. Minimize human error.
4. Swift response mechanism to stop shredder.

## Technologies Used
- Computer Vision (OpenCV)
- Machine Learning

## How It Works
The system monitors hand positions and stops the shredder when a threat is detected.
